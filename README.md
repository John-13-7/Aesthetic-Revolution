## Versions

### 1.0 
Project was created. A alot of component files were added, but not implemented. Basic Metabolic Rate component was implemented, but not complete. Some styling added. 

### 1.1
Nav Bar, Login, Logout, Register Page, and Api added, but not completed. I continued working on states inside the BMR page. 

### 1.2
The front end and the back end were connected. The back end can process registering new users, logging in, and logging out. The back end can continuously check the state of the current user. BMR works correctly, but not complete. Added the Questionaire for the user. Added the Confirmation component, but it needs implementation. More styling was added. Added around 300 recipes, but need to be refined.

### 1.3
Backend now loads the meals, exercises, and details of the user. Fixed a bug where the BMR page would bug when I would go back into the component after I already submimtted. Start implementing the Confirmation component. The component correctly displays all of the user data the component recieved from the Questionaire page. Added 80 different exercies, but need to be refined.
